## Connecting with the community

You can connect with contributors and discuss opportunities to contribute in a few ways:

- Reach out to us on [Slack](http://join.spinnaker.io).
- [Check the calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?showPrint=0&showCalendars=0&mode=AGENDA&height=500&wkst=1&bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&src=spinnaker.io_tr65rjf5mfij7p6vucprkhulcc@group.calendar.google.com&color=%2342104A) and attend a meeting for a [SIG (Special Interest Group)](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/sig-index.md) that focuses on a topic relevant to you.
- Search [Slack](http://join.spinnaker.io) for channels related to topics you're interested in and use channels beginning with `#sig-` to engage with SIGs outside of scheduled meetings.
- Join the next [Spinnaker Gardening Days](/community/gardening/) event.


## Spinnaker development environments

The Spinnaker community is currently working to develop and document a standard environment and toolkit for Spinnaker development. While we get organized, the [Development Environments](/community/gardening/dev-environment/) guide is the most current resource and focuses on development instances of Spinnaker that leverage Kubernetes. If you prefer to set up [Spinnaker services](https://spinnaker.io/reference/architecture/) locally without using Kubernetes, follow this [guide to setting up a dev environment](/guides/developer/getting-set-up/) to get up and running.

Please join the [#dev-toolkit](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/C011LUJ0UQJ) channel in [Slack](http://join.spinnaker.io) to share your feedback or help develop the toolkit.
